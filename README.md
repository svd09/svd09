I am a cardiac surgeon and clinical outcomes researcher. I work at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center. I am an Associate Professor of Surgery at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. I am also a PhD student at the Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow. 

I am interested in using administative databases and large routinely collected data to look at clinically important questions in the field of cardiovascular diseases. I also have a keen interest in biostatistics, survival models, Bayesian analysis and applying newer and more sophisticated methods to better model available data. I enjoy creating small functions and packages in R for my use and find that a great learning experience.
